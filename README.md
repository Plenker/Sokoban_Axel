# Sokoban_Axel

I programmed this game to demonstrate my programming skills in Java.
You can use this code for reviews.
Most of the games are programmed in unity, but my game is developed complete in Android Studio without game loop

Keep focus on:
A repeat Button class execute repeat the function while keeping the button pressed (not a basic function in Android Studio)
Movement can be switched between controler Buttons or Gesture. Click on the Display and the player will move
handy adjustment to implement more levels
The game engine is programmend in own classes - OOP style
animation while moving in each direction
general game rules of the game sokoban
